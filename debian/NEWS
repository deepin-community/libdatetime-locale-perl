libdatetime-locale-perl (1:1.01-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From the upstream Changes file for the 1.00 release:

    [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

    - This is a big new release, and includes a number of
      backwards-incompatible changes. However, most users should be unaffected
      by this change. If you only use this module via DateTime.pm, you are
      unlikely to notice any changes other than changes to the locale data.

  For details please check /usr/share/doc/libdatetime-locale-perl/changelog.gz.
